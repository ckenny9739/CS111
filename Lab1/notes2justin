I have been trying to get command to work properly but it keeps trying to use my arguments to my command as seperate commands.
Hopefully we can end up working with other people to see if they have finished it already.
I have basically been calling
./simpsh --rdonly a --wronly b --wronly c --command 0 1 2 sort
OR
./simpsh --rdonly a --wronly b --wronly c --command 0 1 2 tr A-Z a-z
OR
./simpsh --rdonly a --wronly b --wronly c --command 0 1 2 sort --command 0 1 2 tr A-Z a-z

See if you have any luck... Text me if you have any questions
