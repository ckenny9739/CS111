TODO:
Finish command option
Check all options work correctly
Fix check dist
Redo test cases so that it works
Error checking throughout project
Read spec through once finished to fix any bugs

Implementation:
We used an array of option structs to hold each of our 4 viable options. Then using
a while loop we could go through each of the arguments passed to simpsh.
This lead into a switch statement for each of the options. This allowed us to
make sure that each one did the appropriate thing. --rdonly and --wronly simply
open a file to be read or written into. --verbose sets a verbose flag that will
print out the option and arguments each time through the while loop after the flag
is set. Finally, --command's implementation is more complicated. It involves creating
child processes for each command via a fork() call. Then we used dup2() to set the
correct file descriptors (3 calls - 1 for input, 1 for output, 1 for error). Finally,
we used execvp() to actually issue the command.

Limitations:
--command doesn't work
There is little error checking

Extra Features:
No Extra Features as of now
